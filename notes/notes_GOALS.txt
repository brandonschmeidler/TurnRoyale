####[GAME FLOW NEEDS]####
{ DONE 
    Need to get a basic connection/player spawn established
}

{  
    Client needs to notify server on player ready
    -button to ready up [client] -done
    -emit to server that player is ready [client] -done
    -listen for player ready event [server] -done
    -add ready player to next available match queue [server] (fuck me.... and we need a match queue)
}

{
    Need server match queue where players are placed when they ready up.
    Once enough players are added to the queue, count down and start a match.
}

{
    After the game start countdown server broadcasts to all players that the PLANNING_PHASE_EVENT begins
}

{
    Once client recieves PLANNING_PHASE_EVENT they have a set amount of time to select a sequence of tile positions
    Timer is ran on client. Client sends SELECTED_TILE_SEQUENCE to Server when time runs out
}

{
    Once server recieves and verifies all players' SELECTED_TILE_SEQUENCE, the game switches to MOVEMENT_PHASE which is where everything is calculated
}


####SERVER GAME FROM START TO END####
server starts
server waits for 4 clients to connect
once 4 clients have connected server creates 4 player instances and randomly places them on grid
game starts with planning phase 








####[MISC THOUGHTS]####
Use rooms to split up users between matches and the main matchmaking room
Maybe need "Match" class but the more I think about it the less I think I need it.
Need "Pickup" class for orbs and maybe upgrades or something
Server needs to know map data
Server needs to send map data to client
How is the movement sequence calculated to make sure there is no "first-come-first-serve"? Is that not possible?

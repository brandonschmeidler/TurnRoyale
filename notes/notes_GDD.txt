####GAME RULES####
Each player starts with 10 HP
Each turn a player can move 3 tiles without losing HP
Each turn a player can move 3 extra tiles at the expense of 1 HP per tile
Standard CryptoRoyale color scheme rules. (ColorA kills ColorB kills ColorC kills ColorA)
Manual movement by selecting tiles in sequence. (Arrow keys/Mouse swipe on pc and swipe/tap on mobile)
Map consists of "safe-area" and "dead-space". Players can go into dead-space but lose HP during movement phase.

####IDEAS & QUESTIONS####
Do we build up moves if player doesn't use all tile movements in turn? 

####GAME FLOW####
Grid map loads
Players are positioned randomly on grid
countdown "3-2-1 game start"

####SELECTION PHASE#### [5-10 seconds from player perspective]
-a circle appears showing range of movement for this turn
-plan your next move by selecting tiles in sequence
-selecting active tile will disable it and any tile after to allow mistakes to be fixed

####MOVEMENT PHASE####
-all players in match are moved simultaneously
--[REACTIONS]
--IF (player moves to empty tile) { nothing happens }
--IF (player collides with orb) { player gains 1 HP and changes color if orb is different color. new orb appears somewhere else }
--IF (player move to same tile as another player) { scroll to [player-player-collision] }
--IF (playerA and playerB are next to each other and move to each other's tile) { normal player-player-collision with double knockback and hp loss }
--IF (player is in dead-space) { player loses 1HP }
-after all reactions are calculated movement phase is complete and selection phase begins again.

####GAME END CONDITIONS####
Last player standing wins (what if there is a draw?)
Each turn safe area gets smaller to move the game forward


####PLAYER-PLAYER-COLLISION####
IF (playerA and playerB are the same color) {
    
    IF (playerA.HP == playerB.HP) { // SAME HEALTH

        Both lose 1 (maybe 2?) HP and knocked back to last tile;

    } ELSE IF (playerA.HP > playerB.HP) { // playerA wins

        playerA gains 1 HP;
        playerA stays on tile;
        
        playerB loses 1 HP;
        playerB knocked back to last tile;

    } ELSE IF (playerA.HP < playerB.HP) { // playerB wins

        playerB gains 1 HP;
        playerB stays on tile;
        
        playerA loses 1 HP;
        playerA knocked back to last tile;

    }

} ELSE IF (playerA and playerB are different colors) {

    Standard CryptoRoyale rules apply
    ColorA damages ColorB
    ColorB damages ColorC
    ColorC damages ColorA

    Loser loses 1 HP and is knocked back to last tile.
    Winner gains 1 HP is stays on tile.

}
